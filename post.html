                <h3>Learn Web Development In The Easiest Way</h3>
                <p>Web Development is the building and maintenance of wesites;
                    it's the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website 
                    look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. 
                    Web developers, or 'devs', do this by using a variety of coding languages
                    <br><br>
                    The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are preforming 
                    and the platforms on which they are working.Web development skills are in high 
                    demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career option. 
                    It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional 
                    university degree to become qualified.The field of web development is generally broken 
                    down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server side). Let’s delve 
                    into the details.
                    <br><br>
                    For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds
                    of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while 
                    developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting 
                    developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or 
                    information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments 
                    rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer 
                    specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end 
                    developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end 
                    developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] 
                    developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used 
                    technologies ever.
